Make sure you go through settings file and setup your email and quest stuff.
Currently by default I use gmail smtp, but you can change it to anything.

I included mechanize package because there's a bug with it that I had to patch.
The fix is in the file called "urllib2_fork" and the class "HTTPSConnectionV3"
